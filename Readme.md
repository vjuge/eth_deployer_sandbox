following the discussion I had on linkedin [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/artemchystiakov_ethereum-pattern-anonymity-activity-7049714874112761856-5giS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

In the comments I had some leads to understand and implement a solution:
* [Nick Johnson's blog post](https://weka.medium.com/how-to-send-ether-to-11-440-people-187e332566b7)
